INSTRUCTIONS:

1. You may use the provided executables or run the source code files (using Python or CMD). These files are labeled in their respective folders

2. Two folders will be created when you run both files.
   
   	2.1. When running "client.exe" or "client.py", the folder "Calvara's Server Dump" will be created in your local Windows Downloads folder.
   		This is where files are placed when using the "/get" command
   
   	2.2. When running "server.exe" or "server.py", the folder "Home Depot" will be created.
   		This is where files are placed when using the "/store" command
   
   	2.3. These folders will be created in the same directory as where the ".py" or ".exe" is located.
   
   	2.4. If you want to avoid the automatic creation, you may create the folders yourself, but it should have the same name.

4. The folder "Shopee Delivery" should be created.
